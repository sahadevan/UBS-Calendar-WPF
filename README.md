UBS assignment  - WPF Calendar Control

Build a calendar control with the following features
1.	Ability to see 1 month or multiple months at a time - configurable
2.	Ability view the entire calendar for the year - configurable
3.	Ability to provide a list of holidays and the calendar should highlight the date if it is a holiday and provide the reason for the holiday in the tooltip
No restriction on the look and feel of the control. Basic styling is sufficient and should be demonstrated.
Do not use any 3rd party controls/tools. Only native WPF controls can be used. Application should be easy to build and run.
